# Getting Started

We assume you already have `git` installed on your machine. If not, you can download it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or ask your friendly neighborhood developer for help.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

To clone the repository, open your terminal and run the following command:

```git
git clone https://github.com/prithviulm/qudi-overview.git
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

**If you have Qudi installed, then you already would have all the dependencies for this project and can skip this step.**

You must have Python 3.10 installed on your machine. We assume that you have an anaconda environment set up for Qudi already. If not, ask your friendly neighborhood developer for help.

Run the following command if you are not using a virtual environment or have no idea what a virtual environment is:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or if you are using a virtual environment:

```bash
conda install --file requirements_conda.txt
```
</details>


## Step 3: Open the project

You're probably using PyCharm, so open the project in PyCharm. If you're not using PyCharm, then you either know what you're doing or you should be using PyCharm.

## Step 4: Start Solving the Tasks!
